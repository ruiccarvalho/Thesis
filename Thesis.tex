% Rui's LaTeX and/or editor hacks and notes go here.
% e.g. useful regex to search for in the file.
% Things we want to look for:
% Comments starting with the "TODO" string
% Lines (in the text file) that contain more than two sentence.
% Take into account that some sentences end in doube-quotes
% (with the perid . before it)
%
% TODO Use the oxford comma?
% TODO see how dates are written in English across the whole document
% TODO check if there are i.e. with a "comma" after it
% TODO check how many text between parenthesis and m-dashes is there
% TODO check for double-quote american errors, i.e. commas out of "",
% TODO check for <CAPS LOCK STUFF INSIDE ST/GT SIGNS>
% TODO see how NOVAthesis does the side by side figure thingy
