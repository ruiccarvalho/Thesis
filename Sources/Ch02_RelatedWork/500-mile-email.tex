The case of the 500-mile email~\cite{500mileemail} was an issue described by a systems administrator where e-mails could not be sent to servers further than 500 miles.
The description seemed impossible as e-mail servers (closer) were working, but a hidden configuration---a timeout---rendered a different behavior according to the physical distance between hosts, due to round-trip times.
