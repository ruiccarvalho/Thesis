\chapter{Kathará}
\label{ch:kathara}

In this chapter, we present Kathará in further detail.
Its structure is as follows: in the first section, Kathara's functional capabilities are described from a high-level vantage point, as well as its user interface; then follows a lower-level explanation of this emulation framework's architecture and implementation; finally, a case study identical to the one applied to GNS3 on section~\ref{sec:gns3practicalcasestudy} is presented.
