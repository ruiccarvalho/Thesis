\chapter{Kathar치}
\label{ch:kathara}

In this chapter, the second and last deeper study of a network emulator, to analyze its implementation and assess its suitability in functional and non-functional aspects for usage as replacement for the University's physical lab.

As said before, Kathar치 is a totally new implementation of Netkit, which shares the same declarative language for preconfiguring labs (both the topology in terms of nodes and ``links'', as well as the default behavior and configuration of each node), using an almost identical command-line interface.

Despite having being developed to deploy very different kinds of networks than those of Netkit, Kathar치 is recommended as a successor by its precursor's website.

The structure of this chapter is as follows: in the first section, Kathara's functional capabilities are described from a high-level vantage point, as well as its user interface; then follows a lower-level explanation of this emulation framework's architecture and implementation; finally, a case study identical to the one applied to GNS3 on section~\ref{sec:gns3practicalcasestudy} is presented.
