\chapter{Kathará}
\label{ch:kathara}

In this chapter, we present Kathará in further detail.
Its structure is as follows: in the first section, Kathara's functional capabilities are described from a high-level vantage point, as well as its user interface; then follows a lower-level explanation of this emulation framework's architecture and implementation; finally, a case study identical to the one applied to GNS3 on section~\ref{sec:gns3practicalcasestudy} is presented.

% As said before, Kathará is a new implementation of Netkit, done from the ground up, which shares the same declarative language for preconfiguring labs (both the topology in terms of nodes and ``links'', as well as the default behavior and configuration of each node) with the latter, using an almost identical command-line interface.

% Despite having being developed to deploy very different kinds of networks than those of Netkit, namely software-defined networks, those with programmable data plane nodes, and with virtual network functions, Kathará is recommended as a successor by its precursor's website, since it promises total backwards compatibility, while having a more portable and efficient architecture, thanks to relying on Docker.
