\chapter{Leaving the physical world}
\label{ch:leavingthephysicalworld}

This chapter addresses which of the two technologies---emulation or simulation---is a better answer to the problem presented in the introduction:
in education, how can we avoid the usage of laboratories cluttered with network gear.
We start by showing what are the fundamental characteristics that set them apart, and that emulation has its intrinsic advantages over simulation with regard to the above stated problem.

Finally, it offers a brief overview of the state of the art on the topic of virtualization, which supports, in its lighter or more resource-intensive forms, most of computer network emulators today.
