\chapter{Leaving the physical world}
\label{ch:leavingthephysicalworld}

This chapter is dedicated to show which major types of solutions---emulation and simulation---that allow to respond to the problem presented in the introduction (how to avoid the usage of physical spaces equipped with network gear in education) are there, and what fundamental characteristics distinguish them.
Furthermore, it provides the case for considering the former as viable to solve the stated problem, given their intrinsic advantages, over the other the latter.

It offers a brief overview of the state of the art on the topic of virtualization, which supports, in lighter or heavier forms, most of computer network emulators today.

Finally, it glances over some current usages of simulators and emulators used in education are pointed out.
