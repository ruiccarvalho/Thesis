\chapter{Leaving the physical world}
\label{ch:leavingthephysicalworld}

This chapter is dedicated to show which major types of solutions---emulation and simulation---that allow to respond to the problem presented in the introduction (how to avoid the usage of physical spaces equipped with network gear in education) are there, and what fundamental characteristics distinguish them.
That is mostly what section~\ref{sec:leavingemulationandsimulation} is about.
Also, it provides the case for considering the former as viable to solve the stated problem, given their intrinsic advantages, over the other the latter.

Then, in section~\ref{sec:leavingcurrentusage}, some current usages of simulators and emulators used in education are pointed out.

Further yet, section~\ref{sec:leavingvirtualization}, offers a brief overview of the state of the art in the general underlying technologies supporting computer network emulators---virtualization in its different facets---is given.
The goal there is not to go into details on how virtualization, in its different facets, is implemented, but to describe what are the features and high-level aspects of the technologies available nowadays, as a way to prove why and how they are so crucial for the emulators shown later on.
