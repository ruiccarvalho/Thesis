\section{Summary}
\label{sec:leavingsummary}

In this chapter we presented:
\begin{itemize}
  \item two existing conceptual approaches to replace ``the real thing,'' in the particular case of computer networks, with a virtual alternative by the means of software;
  \item the underlying mechanisms that enable emulation, which is the approach studied in-depth in this dissertation.
\end{itemize}
