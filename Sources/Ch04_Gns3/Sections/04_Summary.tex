\section{Summary}
\label{sec:gns3summary}

This chapter presented GNS3 as an emulator with the following characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a very high-degree of functional realism in comparison with real-world vendors, particularly Cisco, since its primary usage is by running real Cisco networking OSs;
  \item a rich \gls{gui} serving as the main way of interaction with projects and on-going emulations;
  \item relatively heavy-weight due to its ``full-blown \gls{vm}''-first approach;
  \item equipped with mechanisms to facilitate dealing with its demanding resource requirements, namely using more than one machine to execute a single-emulation.
\end{itemize}
