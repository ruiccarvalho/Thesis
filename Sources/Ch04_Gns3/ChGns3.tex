\chapter{GNS3}
\label{ch:gns3}

% GNS3, whose original name was ``Graphical Network Simulator-3,'' is a software project, comprising several distinct components and, despite the ``simulator'' in its name, it falls under the category of emulators (cf.~\ref{sec:emulationsimulation}): its operation runs real code accross all the layers of the stack. % TODO try to (either with a source, or speculating) relate the name with ns-3
% TODO also: cite the source for the name
% By ``as a whole,'' it is meant that, as shall be seen later, although some of its components, like the Dynamips program, are emulators in a very strict sense---i.e. its purpose is to run real machine code on a different hardware architecture (than its native one)---, it differentiates itself, on a high-level perspective, from a simulator which is a program designed to execute a mathematical model, processing modeled events as internal data-structures with a collection of preset algorithms that somehow mimic (a part of) the reality. % TODO: delete?

% Note that a necessary step towards the goal of this this thesis is to systematize a technical description of the architecture and functional underpinnings of the GNS3 system.
% How does it interact with the hardware and software it is running in, how much resources does it take to work with GNS3 according to the ``mode'' it is running in, etc., as that is an aspect that is yet to be further explored for, at least, the following reasons:  % TODO improve the writing how is etc written in Engilsh?
% on the one hand, the consulted academic material (i.e. research papers, mostly) is very brief and omissive in regards to the design, architecture and implementation of GNS3, and so is the official website and documentation; on the other hand, many interesting details are in the ``paraofficial'' videos available via YouTube, mostly by David Bombal,\footnote{\url{https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP7WmQ_U4GB3K51Od9QvM0w}} namely a comprehensive overview of the architecture (compared with the functionality) of GNS3 by its creator, Jeremy Grossmann, and essentially are not anywhere else, at least from authoritative sources. % TODO same as the previous "sentence". Cite the videos (how and which ones?)

% TODO add a figure (a screen shot) showing the "official" submitter of GNS3 videos (and maybe the channel and/or links from the gns3 official website)

% end of intro

% The first section of this chapter explains the motivation behind the creation of GNS3, as that fact determines implementation and functional aspects of this piece of software.
This chapter consists in a detailed analysis and study of one of the two examples given in chapter~\ref{ch:examplesofemulators} which were chosen to be looked into more depth and, later, compared against each other---the GNS3 emulator.
First, two sections present GNS3 from a more technical angle:
  \begin{enumerate*}[label=(\roman*), itemjoin={{, }}, itemjoin*={{, and }}]
  \item a description of the architecture and the main design characteristics of GNS3 are explained, giving a good overview of the kind of setup it needs, and in what kind of environments it can be executed and inherent scalability features
  \item the implementation solutions chosen by GNS3's developers to provide its high-level functionality.
  \end{enumerate*}
Then, the chapter finishes by presenting a case-study that directly addresses the problem which motivates this thesis and describes how GNS3 offers solutions for that problem, and proposing some performance and resource consumption considerations, as a result of the observations made mainly during the execution of the case-study.
