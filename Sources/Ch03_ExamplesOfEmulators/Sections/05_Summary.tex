\section{Summary}
\label{sec:exemulsummary}

In this chapter we gave an overview of several network emulators, namely Mininet, GNS3, Kathar√° (while mentioning its predecessor, Netkit), and CORE.

In the next three chapters, we will dive deep in the analysis of functional and non-functional aspects, and also practical usage tests, for the last three of the aforementioned emulation tools.
