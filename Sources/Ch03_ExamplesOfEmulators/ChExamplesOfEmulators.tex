\chapter{Examples of emulators}
\label{ch:examplesofemulators}

This chapter offers an overview of four emulators, all different from one another in implementation, functionality, extensibility, user interaction capabilities, and even in the problems they were built to address.

It is not an in-depth approach, but an introduction to allow to establish what we believe is a representative sample of approaches in the field, trying to describe the context of their conceptions, as well as details relevant to highlight the differences between them in the aforementioned aspects.
