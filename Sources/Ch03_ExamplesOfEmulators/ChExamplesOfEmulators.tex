\chapter{Examples of emulators}
\label{ch:examplesofemulators}

This chapter offers an overview of four emulators, all different from one another in implementation, functionality, extensibility, user interaction capabilities, and even in the problems they were built to address.

It is not an in-depth study, but an introduction that allows us to present a set we believe is a representative sample of approaches in the field; we try to describe the context and motivations that drove their development, important concepts, and details that are deemed relevant to highlight the differences between them in the aforementioned aspects.
