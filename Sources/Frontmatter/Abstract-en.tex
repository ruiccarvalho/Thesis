\textbf{\Large Abstract}

In recent years computer networks emulators have been developed, mostly relying on virtualization technologies, which allow performing experiments that reproduce in a quite realistic way what happens in a real network.

In parallel, not only do personal computers (PCs) have nowadays much more resources (memory capacity, processor speed, etc.) than a few years ago, but Internet connectivity is increasingly ubiquitous, facilitating contact with powerful infrastructures, in the so-called \emph{cloud} or in institutional data-centers, which can be relied upon to set up experiments with emulators, in cases where these require more resources than those available on a PC.

This thesis critically and comparatively assesses how two paradigmatic examples of modern emulators, GNS3 and Kathar√°, provide answers to existing problems in teaching, learning, and experimental research in computer networks, namely whether it is possible, thanks to them, to mitigate or eliminate the dependency on a laboratory with physical equipment to perform certain practical exercises.

\textbf{Keywords:} Computer networks; emulators; virtualization; education.
