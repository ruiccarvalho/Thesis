\chapter{Conclusions and further work}
\label{ch:conclusions}

In this chapter, our provisional conclusions, we're not doing nothing else than using a term in the glossary to force it to be printed.
We have decided that term to be~\gls{Real numbers}.

With this, we conclude this long document.
Thank you for reading!
