\chapter{Comparative Analysis}
\label{ch:comparative}

In this chapter, the results of the experimentation with and in-depth study of GNS3, Kathar√°, and CORE (chapters~\ref{ch:gns3}, \ref{ch:kathara}, and~\ref{ch:core}, respectively) are exposed in a comparative way, so that the strengths and weaknesses of each one---either in general or from an ``absolute'' point of view, but especially for relative to the application intended in this dissertation, which is teaching, learning, and studying in the context of university courses---are clearer and an informed choice can be made, for example, in the moment of planning a course.

The structure of the chapter is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item In section~\ref{sec:comparativefunctionality}, we compare the functional aspects of the two emulators, i.e. what \emph{can} they do and what they \emph{can't}.
  \item In section~\ref{sec:comparativenonfunctional}, we focus on most of the non-functional aspects, namely how user friendly they are to perform some of the tasks and how some design decisions make each one more suitable for some types of usage than for others.
  \item Section~\ref{sec:comparativeperformance} is dedicated to a particular non-functional attribute of the emulators, which is performance (and resource consumption).
\end{itemize}
