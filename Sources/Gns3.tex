\chapter{GNS3}
\label{ch:gns3}

GNS3, whose original title was ``Graphical Network Simulator-3,'' is a software project, comprising several distinct components and, despite the ``simulator'' in its name, \emph{as a whole} falls under the category that, in this dissertation, we call an \emph{emulator}.
By ``as a whole'', it is meant that, as shall be seen later, although some of its components, like the Dynamips program, are emulators in a strict sense---i.e. serve to run real machine code on a different (than its native one) hardware architecture---, it differenciates itself on a high-level perspective from a simulator which is a program designded to execute a mathematical model, processing modeled events as internal data-structures with a set of preset algorithms that somehow mimic a (part) of the reality.
