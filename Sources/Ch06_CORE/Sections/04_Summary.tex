\section{Summary}
\label{sec:coresummary}

CORE, the emulator presented in detail in this chapter, has the following main attributes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item is lightweight due to relying on an OS-level container mechanism without any external orchestration tools;
  \item performs well on large topologies on a single laptop;
  \item privileges the usage of a graphical interface, although this interface is not ideal;
  \item is used in both universities and the industry, but for domain-specific usages, like routing in wireless networks.
\end{itemize}
