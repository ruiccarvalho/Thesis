\chapter{CORE}
\label{ch:core}

This chapter offers a deeper analysis of the CORE emulator, briefly introduced in chapter~\ref{ch:examplesofemulators}.
It follows a similar structure to the one in the chapters for GNS3 and Kathar√° (\ref{ch:gns3} and \ref{ch:kathara}).
We begin by describing the architecture and technical traits of the software; then, we proceed to describe its interface and practical aspects; finally, we present the routing case-study used to better assess the pros and cons between this emulator and the others studied in the dissertation.
