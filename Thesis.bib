@article{ZHANG2012504,
	Abstract = {It is one of the most concerns to improve the innovation and creativity of college students in China. Researchers have developed many pedagogical tools to improve the creativity of students. Because classroom is still the main place to get face--to--face education for undergraduate students in China, it is necessary for teachers to know how to create a creative culture environment when lecturing. This paper will discuss how to improve students' innovation in computer network course. Computer network is a complex and evolving topic. Students usually find this subject technical and boring. Teaching computer network is challenging because of the abstract network concepts. This paper presents a visual educational tool named Packet Tracer and shows how it can be used for teaching innovation in computer network courses. Packet Tracer provides the network simulation, visualization and collaboration capabilities. It can not only help students to understand computer network principles but also improve students' network practical skills. With Packet Tracer tools, students can design solutions for the projects. Positive feedbacks from students and teaching team show that the visual tools and designed projects make students more innovative and creative},
